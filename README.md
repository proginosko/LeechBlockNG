LeechBlock NG (Next Generation) is a simple productivity tool designed to block those time-wasting sites that can suck the life out of your working day. All you need to do is specify which sites to block and when to block them.

Note that the latest version of [jQuery UI](https://jqueryui.com/) should be installed in the subfolder `jquery-ui`.

**Policy on PRs:** I'm happy to consider PRs, but unless they're relatively simple (e.g., bug fixes or UI tweaks) it will take me some time to review and test them, and even then I may decide not to approve them. Please understand that LeechBlock is just a hobby for me, and I have very little time even to develop my own code, never mind other people's code! If you want to fork LeechBlock and release your own version, you're more than welcome.
